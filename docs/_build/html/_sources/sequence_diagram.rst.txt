In the first loop, in which the path planning occurs, the planner gets the goal
state as an action goal, elevation map data, and robotâ€™s current state. Once the
solution is found, it triggers the second loop, which is for path following task.
In simulation mode, ``path_follower`` would act as local planner, using a PID controller, 
while in the real world experiment, ``goal_publisher`` sends the next waypoint to the Spot robot's 
available local planner.
