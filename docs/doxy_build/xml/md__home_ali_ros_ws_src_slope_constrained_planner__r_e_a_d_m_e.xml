    <title>Slope-Informed Global Path Planning for Quadruped Robots</title>
    <briefdescription>
    </briefdescription>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>This work describes the initial steps in developing a global path planner for a quadruped robot designed to traverse outdoor environments with uneven terrains. The ultimate goal is to generate paths that strike a balance between path length, tortuousness, energy efficiency, and safety when encountering slopes. The article details the system architecture and the implemented planning method, which incorporates slope constraints into a roadmap-based approach to generate paths with various characteristics. The algorithm has undergone extensive testing, both in simulation and with the Spot robot from Boston Dynamics. In both sets of experiments, noticeable differences were observed when adjusting the constraints on the robot’s maximum allowable inclination angles.

<para>Once the robot is spawned in a random point by <computeroutput>go0.py</computeroutput> script, a random goal point would be chosen on the map with a particular distance to robot.

<title>System hypothesis and future work</title>
<para>We implemented a global path planner algorithm able to take into account constraints on the slope a quadruped robot can face outdoor. The presence slope constraints effectively influences the generated path in a way that allows for longer paths but limited slope or vice versa. We observed these results both in simulation and in real-world experiments with the Spot robot from Boston Dynamics.</para>
<para>In future work, we plan to conduct more extensive testing with the Spot robot on steeper hills to thoroughly assess the algorithm’s limitations. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of various solutions on battery consumption to determine potential differences in energy efficiency. This research will ultimately contribute to the development of a system that emulates human versatility in making decisions regarding slope navigation. The robot may opt to follow a longer (and potentially safer) path or a shorter (but more energy-intensive) path, taking into account factors such as task requirements, time constraints, payload, battery charge, and other relevant parameters. </para>
