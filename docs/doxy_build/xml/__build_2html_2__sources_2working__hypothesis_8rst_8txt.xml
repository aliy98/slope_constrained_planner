        <initializer>======================================


We implemented a global path planner algorithm able to take into account constraints on the slope a 
quadruped robot can face outdoor. The presence slope constraints effectively influences the generated 
path in a way that allows for longer paths but limited slope or vice versa. We observed these results 
both in simulation and in real-world experiments with the Spot robot from Boston Dynamics.

In future work</initializer>
